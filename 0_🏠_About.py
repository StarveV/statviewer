    This website collects data by scraping the designated subreddit, including r/wallstreetbet, to retrieve all 
    posts and threads posted in the past seven days. The data is stored in MongoDB and undergoes entity recognition 
    and sentiment analysis using two distinct deep learning models, SPACY and a BERT-based model. The heat map/tree 
    map displays the most-discussed tickers and companies in the selected subreddit, along with their respective RBI 
    for the past seven days. This provides a clear and intuitive way to identify the most-discussed stocks and understand 
    the bullish or bearish sentiment of redditors towards them.

# RBI
st.markdown('### Redditor Bullish Index (RBI).')
st.write('''
    The Redditor Bullish Index (RBI). is inspired by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) 
    and the Volatility Index (VIX) and seeks to measure retail investors' emotions. The sentiment 
    score is determined by analyzing all entities identified in posts within the designated subreddit 
    over the past seven days. Two distinct deep learning models, a SPACY model for entity recognition 
    and a BERT-based model for sentiment analysis, are used to extract the discussed stock or company 
    and perform sentiment analysis, respectively. The weighted score of the stock's occurrence and sentiment 
    score is then calculated to form the RBI.

    Compared to traditional financial indicators, the RBI provides a more accurate reflection of retail investors' 
    emotions and highlights the most-discussed stocks among retail investors. However, it is important to note that 
    the RBI may lag in time and may not accurately reflect investors' emotions at a specific time frame, as it is based 
    on all posts from the past seven days.
